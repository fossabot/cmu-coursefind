I saw students having classes and hoped to find out what classes they were having. I could just walk in and see what was going on, but it would be much better if I knew something about the class.\r\n\r\nWith CourseFind, students can easily find out what’s going on in a class room. So they can explore what’s course is interests them. CourseFind is also great for finding the room for a class, or just browsing the catalog to find what’s interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How do I get set up? ##\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Configuration\r\n\r\n    This website uses Django as the backend framework. Follow the instruction on [https://www.djangoproject.com/download/](Link URL) to install Django.\r\n\r\n    To run the site locally, cd into the coursefind-django folder, and run\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ python3 manage.py runserver\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Project Structure ##\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── app\r\n│   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   ├── <Main python code>\r\n│   ├── models.py\r\n│   ├── static\r\n│   │   └── app ...\r\n│   ├── templates\r\n│   │   └── app\r\n│   │       ├── <The templates>\r\n│   ├── templatetags\r\n│   │   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   │   └── template_filter.py\r\n│   ├── tests.py\r\n│   ├── utilities.py\r\n│   └── views.py\r\n├── coursefind\r\n│   ├── __init__.py\r\n│   ├── settings.py\r\n│   ├── urls.py\r\n│   └── wsgi.py\r\n├── db.sqlite3\r\n└── manage.py\r\n```\r\n",
