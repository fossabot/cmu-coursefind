        <br>
        CMU Course Find was a 15-112 term project by Justin Chu (me) during the Fall 2015 semester at Carnegie Mellon University. It is still an on going project. This site is proudly using <a href="http://materializecss.com" class="grey-text text-darken-3">Materialize</a>, a CSS Framework by CMU students.
        <br><br>
        I had this idea one day when I was wandering in Wean Hall. I saw students having class and hoped to find out what class they were having. I could just walk in and see what was going on, but it would be much better if I knew something about the class.
        <br><br>
        CMU Course Find makes it easier for you to figure out what’s going on in a class room. You can also see <b>what’s happening</b> at a particular time, so you can <b>go and discover</b> courses that interest you. This web app is also great for finding the room for a class, or just browsing the catalog to see what’s interesting.
        <br><br>
        To find a course, you may search for the name of a course, name of instructors, name of a building, number of a course, or a room number. You can further view course description and reviews on <a href="http://cmucoursereviews.me" class="grey-text text-darken-3">cmucoursereviews.me</a>, also a 112 term project by Amit Nambiar.
